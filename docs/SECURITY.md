# Security Design

## Comprehensive Security Framework

### Threat Model

The Ollama Agent Mode Proxy is designed with a robust security model addressing potential risks in AI-powered code generation and execution environments.

## Security Principles

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege
- Minimal access rights for tools
- Granular permission controls
- Restricted workspace access

### 2. Isolation and Containment
- Containerized tool execution
- Workspace path restrictions
- Sandboxed environment

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization
- Strict parameter validation
- Prevent command injection
- Sanitize all user inputs

## Security Mechanisms

### Workspace Isolation
- Defined root workspace directory
- Prevent directory traversal attacks
- Block access to sensitive system directories

```python
def validate_workspace_path(path):
    """
    Ensure path is within allowed workspace
    """
    workspace_root = Path('/secure/workspace')
    try:
        # Resolve to absolute path and check if it's under workspace
        resolved_path = Path(path).resolve()
        if workspace_root not in resolved_path.parents:
            raise SecurityException("Path outside workspace")
    except Exception as e:
        log_security_event(f"Workspace violation: {path}")
        raise
```

### Execution Sandboxing
- Docker-based isolation
- Resource limitations
- Network restrictions

```yaml
# Docker security constraints
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
  - apparmor:docker-default
resources:
  cpus: '0.5'
  memory: 512M
network_mode: none
```

### Permission Management
- User confirmation for destructive actions
- Role-based access control
- Detailed execution logging

```python
class SecureToolExecutor:
    async def execute_tool(self, tool_name, params):
        # Check user permissions
        if not self.has_permission(tool_name):
            raise PermissionDenied("Insufficient permissions")
        
        # Log security events
        self.log_security_event(tool_name, params)
        
        # Execute with limited privileges
        return await self._execute_in_sandbox(tool_name, params)
```

## Threat Prevention

### 1. Code Injection Protection
- Sanitize all input parameters
- Use parameterized execution
- Prevent shell command injection

### 2. Denial of Service (DoS) Mitigation
- Request rate limiting
- Execution time constraints
- Resource usage caps

### 3. Data Exposure Prevention
- Redact sensitive information
- Secure logging practices
- Prevent information leakage

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Logging Framework
- Detailed execution logs
- Security event tracking
- Immutable audit trail

```python
def log_security_event(event_type, details):
    """
    Secure, structured logging of security events
    """
    log_entry = {
        'timestamp': datetime.now(),
        'event_type': event_type,
        'user': current_user,
        'details': details,
        'ip_address': request.client.host
    }
    secure_logger.log(log_entry)
```

### Metrics and Alerting
- Prometheus metrics for security events
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Automated incident response

## Compliance Considerations

- OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- Principle of Defense in Depth
- Regular security audits

## Recommended Configuration

```bash
# Recommended security settings
WORKSPACE_ROOT=/secure/workspace
MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=60  # seconds
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=10  # per minute
ENABLE_USER_CONFIRMATION=true
```

## Ongoing Security

- Regular dependency updates
- Continuous security testing
- Community-driven vulnerability reporting

## Incident Response

1. Immediate containment
2. Detailed forensic analysis
3. System recovery
4. Prevention strategy update
